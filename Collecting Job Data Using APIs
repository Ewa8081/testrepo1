Warm-Up Exercise
Before you attempt the actual lab, here is a fully solved warmup exercise that will help you to learn how to access an API.

Using an API, let us find out who currently are on the International Space Station (ISS).
The API at http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json gives us the information of astronauts currently on ISS in json format.
You can read more about this API at http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/People-In-Space/

import requests # you need this module to make an API call
